Resolving Conflicts During a Cherry-Pick Operation
Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://site.your.some.site
```

Fetch the Latest Changes

Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository:

```bash
git fetch origin
```

Cherry-Pick Changes

Cherry-pick the specific commit from the source branch:

```bash
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

Git will attempt to apply the changes from the specified commit. If there are conflicts, it will pause the cherry-pick operation.

Identify Conflicting Files

Check which files have conflicts:

```bash
git status
```

Inspect Conflicts

Open each conflicting file to review the conflicts. Conflicts will be marked similarly:

```plaintext
<<<<<<< HEAD
// Code from the current branch
// Code from the cherry-picked commit

<commit-hash>  
```

Resolve Conflicts

Decide how to resolve each conflict. 
Modify the code to resolve conflicts manually in each conflicted file.

Mark Conflicts as Resolved

After resolving conflicts in a file, mark it as resolved:

```bash
git add <file-path>
```

Repeat this for each conflicted file.

Complete the Cherry-Pick

Continue the cherry-pick process to complete the operation:

```bash
git cherry-pick --continue
```

If needed, abort the cherry-pick with:

```bash
git cherry-pick --abort
```

This cancels the cherry-pick operation entirely.
